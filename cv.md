## Code Example:

#### Calculation of the discriminant for solving a quadratic equation.
#### a*x*x + b*x + c = 0
#### Given values a, b, and c for quadratic equation.
#### Needed to display possible values of x for this equation.
```
let a = 3;
let b = 5;
let c = 10;

let d = b * b - 4 * a * c;
```
#### discriminant root calculation
```
let dRoot = Math.sqrt(d);
console.log("x1 = ", (-b + dRoot) / (2 * a));
console.log("x2 = ", (-b - dRoot) / (2 * a));
```
